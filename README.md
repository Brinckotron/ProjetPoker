## üöÄ Key Technical Achievements

### **üèóÔ∏è Advanced Architecture Patterns**

#### **Singleton Pattern Implementation**
```csharp
// Clean singleton with proper null checking and scene persistence
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private static GameManager _instance;
    public static GameManager Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null) Debug.LogError("GameManager is NULL");
            return _instance;
        }
    }
    
    private void Awake()
    {
        if (_instance) Destroy(gameObject);
        else _instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(this);
    }
}
```

#### **Observer Pattern with Events**
```csharp
// Event-driven coin system with automatic UI updates
public delegate void CoinDelegate();
public static event CoinDelegate OnChange;

public int Coins
{
    get => coins;
    set
    {
        coins = value;
        if (OnChange != null) OnChange();
    }
}
```

#### **State Machine Design**
- **Turn-based combat** with complex state transitions
- **Scene management** across Menu ‚Üí Shop ‚Üí Combat flow  
- **Card states** (Selected, Kept, In-Hand, Discarded) with visual feedback

---

### **üéÆ Complex Game Systems**

#### **Poker Hand Recognition Engine**
Custom algorithm that identifies all poker combinations:
- **Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind**
- **Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind**  
- **Two Pairs, Pair, High Card**
- **Tie-breaking logic** with proper Ace handling (high/low)

#### **Advanced AI System**
Enemy AI with escalating difficulty:
- **Rounds 1-6**: Basic play patterns
- **Rounds 7-10**: Strategic card replacement based on hand quality
- **Adaptive decision making** - AI discards weak cards to improve hands

#### **Roguelite Progression Systems**

**Relic System** (Permanent Upgrades):
- **Magic Shades** - Reveals enemy cards when player health ‚â§ 50%
- **Golden Cards** - Increases card keeping limit from 2 to 3
- **Heart of Steel** - Increases max health from 20 to 30
- **Precision Scope** - +2 damage bonus for 3+ card combinations

**Special Card Types**:
- **Damage Cards** - Deal 2 damage instead of 1
- **Bank Cards** - Generate 2 coins when drawn
- **Heal Cards** - Restore 1 health when drawn
- **Free Cards** - Don't count against keep limit

**Consumable Items**:
- **Medkit** - Instant 5 health restoration
- **Mulligan** - Extra draw per turn
- **No Thank You** - Force enemy card redraw
- **Damage Boost** - +1 damage per card in winning hand

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation Highlights**

#### **Card Animation System**
Sophisticated card movement with coroutines:
```csharp
public IEnumerator DrawAnimation()
{
    GameObject carteVerso = Instantiate(CarteVerso, deckTransform);
    for (float i = 0; i < 11; i++)
    {
        carteVerso.transform.position = Vector2.Lerp(deckTransform.position, transform.position, i / 10);
        carteVerso.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(deckTransform.rotation, transform.rotation, i / 10);
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.05f);
    }
    Enabled(true);
    Destroy(carteVerso);
}
```

#### **Dynamic UI Management**
- **Real-time inventory visualization** with sprite mapping
- **Adaptive positioning system** for poker hand displays
- **Contextual message system** with fade animations
- **Responsive audio volume controls** with persistence

#### **Data Structures & Algorithms**

**Efficient Deck Management**:
```csharp
// Fisher-Yates shuffle implementation
public void ShuffleDeck()
{
    var temp = new List<CarteData>();
    while (_enemyDeck.Count > 0)
    {
        int indexRandom = Random.Range(0, _enemyDeck.Count);
        temp.Add((_enemyDeck[indexRandom]));
        _enemyDeck.RemoveAt(indexRandom);
    }
    _enemyDeck = temp;
}
```

**Optimized Combo Detection**:
- **O(n¬≤) pair detection** for efficient hand analysis
- **Sorted array comparison** for straight detection
- **Symbol equality checking** for flush detection

- **Visual state indicators** (Selected: Yellow, Kept: Green, Default: Black)
- **Contextual button states** with dynamic text updates
- **Loading animations** with smooth scene transitions

#### **Accessibility Features**
